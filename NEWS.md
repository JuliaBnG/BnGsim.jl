# BnGsim.jl release notes

## v0.1.0

First registered release. It supports Julia 1.10 (LTS) through 1.13 and
requires BnGStructs 0.2.7, FisherWright 0.6 and RelationshipMatrices 0.6.1.

- Forward breeding simulation moved here from Breeding.jl (≤ 0.1.8) and was
  rewritten on the BnGStructs types: `sum_map`, `crossovers`, `gamete!`,
  `gene_drop`/`gene_drop!`, `random_mate`, `rnd_ped`, `expand`,
  `sample_id`, `sample_loci`, `eqtl`, `norm_mv!`, `tbv!`, `phenotype!` and
  `dummy_traits`. The camel-case aliases `sumMap`, `sampleID` and
  `sampleLoci` are kept. The old `BitMatrix`-based files are removed.
- `phenotype!` adds correlated residuals (`R_e`), sex-limited expression
  and threshold (`tTrait`) traits.
- Founders: `HistoricalSpec`, `historical_population`,
  `continue_population`, `founder_haplotypes`, `read_packed_haplotypes`,
  `write_xy`, and `FounderPopulation`/`sample_founder_population`
  (`VariantMap` and `LocusSet` based).
- Founder diagnostics: `founder_summary`, `ld_decay`, `vanraden_g`.
- `provenance` writes a reproducibility header with host, threads, seed,
  and the version and git commit of each package. Breeding.jl is not a
  dependency (it requires Julia ≥ 1.12) and is listed only when loaded.
- Docs: a roadmap page replaces the earlier working plans.
